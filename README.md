# manx-gaelic-llm
An experimental open-source Large Language Model for the Manx Gaelic (Gaelg) language

This project aims to support and promote the revitalisation of the Manx Gaelic language and to aid in learning this language.

Status: The project contains a tokenizer with a small corpus of ca. 300 sentences and a vocabulary of 204. It is currently a research project and not ready for public use.

Sources for the corpus: The corpus has been based on my own learning notes and inspired by the textbook Keim Nane and beginner lessons on the website learnmanx.com. At this stage the corpus is experimental. All data has been created by me and any sentences inspired by the above sources have been rephrased or paraphrased.

Further development: The next stage of the project includes expanding the corpus and creating a tiny LLM. The tiny LLM will then be trained on the corpus. As the project progresses, my aim is to release small demos and seek collaboration with members of the Manx-speaking community. A full, open-source pipeline is planned. 

Resources that I used to build the LLM: 
My own programming knowledge
Tutorials: Code your own Llama 4 from scratch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biveB0gOlak&list=WL&index=79&t=12s
